It's simple to get started building new experiences using the Foundation building blocks.

Let's start by walking through Foundation's subgraphs.

You can use the data from our subgraphs via GraphQL to build a UI that displays Foundation NFTs, tracks the onchain activity in our market contract, etc.

No need to ask our permission or pay us to get an API key or anythingâ€”the data is all free and publicly available.
