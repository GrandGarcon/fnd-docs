It's simple to get started adding new amazing products on marketplace using atelio docs. 


Our main aim is to create an  marketplace for 3d printed products which enthrusts the quality  of the printed products being searched by  expected by the user.  

You could make an Instagram-like experience with NFTs. Or you could make more of a financial app for those trading NFTs. Really pretty much anything - people are actively reimagining the internet collabortively as you read this.

No need to ask anyone's permission or pay us to get an API key or anythingâ€”the data is all free and publicly available. You can build an app on the Foundation contracts and subgraph today, your app will live on no matter what. NFTs live on a blockchain, always available via Ethereum. Subgraph data is managed by The Graph's community and does not depend on Foundation in any way. It works because other people are supporting it.

Don't like a feature of the Foundation app? You can create your own.


Let's start by walking through Atelio's  subgraphs : the best of the open ontology of the  additive manufacturing marketplace currently available in the  open source ecosystem. 

You can use the data from the Foundation subgraphs via GraphQL to build a UI that displays Foundation NFTs, tracks the onchain activity in the Foundation market contract, etc.
