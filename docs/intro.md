It's simple to get started building new experiences using the Foundation building blocks.

Foundation's tech is open, decentralized, and permissionless.

You could make an Instagram-like experience with NFTs. Or you could make more of a financial app for those trading NFTs. Really pretty much anything - people are actively reimagining the internet collabortively as you read this.

No need to ask our permission or pay us to get an API key or anythingâ€”the data is all free and publicly available. You can build an app on our contracts and subgraph today, and even if Foundation disappears, your app will live on. Don't like a feature of the Foundation app? You can create your own.

Let's start by walking through Foundation's subgraphs.

You can use the data from our subgraphs via GraphQL to build a UI that displays Foundation NFTs, tracks the onchain activity in our market contract, etc.
